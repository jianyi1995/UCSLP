Okay, let's see. I need to pick the best solution from s1 to s2 based on the problem's two objectives: minimizing the total waiting time and maximizing the revenue. Let me break this down step by step.

First, let me recap the problem. We have 10 users (v1 to v10) and 4 possible charging stations (v11 to v14). Each solution selects a subset of these stations. The two objectives are conflicting, so I need to evaluate each solution on both and see which one is the best trade-off.

First, let me understand the problem. We have users (V^U) which are v1 to v10, and charging stations (V^S) which are v11 to v14. Each user is assigned to the nearest open charging station. The waiting time for each station is calculated based on the number of users assigned to it divided by the number of charging piles, and if that exceeds 24 hours divided by the charging time (which is 360 minutes, so 6 hours per charge), then there's a squared penalty. The first objective is to minimize the sum of these waiting times. The second objective is to maximize the revenue, which is the total charging fee (10 per user, times 10 users) minus the sum of running costs of the selected stations.

So the two objectives are conflicting: opening more stations reduces waiting time (since users can be spread out more) but increases running costs, thus reducing revenue. So we need to evaluate each solution based on both objectives and determine which is better. But how to compare them when there are two objectives? The problem says to pick the "best" solution, which might mean a trade-off between the two, or maybe one solution dominates the other in both objectives. Let's check.

First, let's parse the reference solutions:

s1 selects v11 and v12. Both have cp_i of 1 and 1, and running costs 6 and 7. So total running cost is 6+7=13.

s2 selects v11 and v14. v11 has cp=1, cost=6; v14 has cp=2, cost=8. Total running cost 6+8=14.

Wait, but the charging stations are v11, v12, v13, v14. The cp and c_i for each:

v11: cp=1, c=6

v12: cp=1, c=7

v13: cp=2, c=13

v14: cp=2, c=8

So for s1: stations v11 and v12 are open. Each has 1 charging pile.

For s2: stations v11 and v14 are open. v11 has 1 pile, v14 has 2.

Now, we need to assign each user (v1 to v10) to their nearest open station in each solution.

First, let's get all coordinates:

Users (v1 to v10):

v1: (10,5)

v2: (9,3)

v3: (12,10)

v4: (4,3)

v5: (7,10)

v6: (0,11)

v7: (7,1)

v8: (1,0)

v9: (8,9)

v10: (2,4)

Charging stations (v11 to v14):

v11: (15,9)

v12: (7,12)

v13: (15,14)

v14: (4,7)

First, let's handle solution s1: open stations are v11 and v12.

For each user, calculate Manhattan distance to v11 and v12, pick the closer one.

v1: (10,5)

Distance to v11 (15,9): |10-15| + |5-9| =5 +4=9

Distance to v12 (7,12): |10-7| + |5-12|=3 +7=10

So v1 is closer to v11.

v2: (9,3)

v11: |9-15| + |3-9|=6+6=12

v12: |9-7| + |3-12|=2+9=11

Closer to v12.

v3: (12,10)

v11: |12-15| + |10-9|=3+1=4

v12: |12-7| + |10-12|=5+2=7

Closer to v11.

v4: (4,3)

v11: |4-15| + |3-9|=11+6=17

v12: |4-7| + |3-12|=3+9=12

Closer to v12.

v5: (7,10)

v11: |7-15| + |10-9|=8+1=9

v12: |7-7| + |10-12|=0+2=2

Closer to v12.

v6: (0,11)

v11: |0-15| + |11-9|=15+2=17

v12: |0-7| + |11-12|=7+1=8

Closer to v12.

v7: (7,1)

v11: |7-15| + |1-9|=8+8=16

v12: |7-7| + |1-12|=0+11=11

Closer to v12.

v8: (1,0)

v11: |1-15| + |0-9|=14+9=23

v12: |1-7| + |0-12|=6+12=18

Closer to v12.

v9: (8,9)

v11: |8-15| + |9-9|=7+0=7

v12: |8-7| + |9-12|=1+3=4

Closer to v12.

v10: (2,4)

v11: |2-15| + |4-9|=13+5=18

v12: |2-7| + |4-12|=5+8=13

Closer to v12.

So assignments for s1:

v11: v1, v3

v12: v2, v4, v5, v6, v7, v8, v9, v10

So sn_i for v11: 2 users, v12: 8 users.

Now compute waiting time for each station.

Formula: wt_i = [max(0, (sn_i / cp_i) - (24 / t)]²

But t is charging time in minutes. Wait, charging time is 360 minutes, which is 6 hours. So 24 hours / 6 hours = 4. So each charging pile can handle 4 users per day.

Thus, for each station, compute (sn_i / cp_i) - 4. If positive, square it, else 0.

For s1:

v11: sn=2, cp=1 → 2/1=2 → 2 -4 = -2 → max 0 → wt=0²=0

v12: sn=8, cp=1 →8/1=8 →8-4=4 → wt=4²=16

Total wt for s1: 0 +16=16

Revenue: cf * |V^U| - sum(c_i * z_i)

cf=10, |V^U|=10 → 10*10=100

Sum c_i: 6 (v11) +7 (v12)=13

Revenue:100 -13=87

Now solution s2: open v11 and v14.

So stations v11 (15,9) and v14 (4,7)

Compute distances for each user to these two.

v1: (10,5)

v11: |10-15| + |5-9|=5+4=9

v14: |10-4| + |5-7|=6+2=8

Closer to v14.

v2: (9,3)

v11: |9-15| + |3-9|=6+6=12

v14: |9-4| + |3-7|=5+4=9

Closer to v14.

v3: (12,10)

v11: |12-15| + |10-9|=3+1=4

v14: |12-4| + |10-7|=8+3=11

Closer to v11.

v4: (4,3)

v11: |4-15| + |3-9|=11+6=17

v14: |4-4| + |3-7|=0+4=4

Closer to v14.

v5: (7,10)

v11: |7-15| + |10-9|=8+1=9

v14: |7-4| + |10-7|=3+3=6

Closer to v14.

v6: (0,11)

v11: |0-15| + |11-9|=15+2=17

v14: |0-4| + |11-7|=4+4=8

Closer to v14.

v7: (7,1)

v11: |7-15| + |1-9|=8+8=16

v14: |7-4| + |1-7|=3+6=9

Closer to v14.

v8: (1,0)

v11: |1-15| + |0-9|=14+9=23

v14: |1-4| + |0-7|=3+7=10

Closer to v14.

v9: (8,9)

v11: |8-15| + |9-9|=7+0=7

v14: |8-4| + |9-7|=4+2=6

Closer to v14.

v10: (2,4)

v11: |2-15| + |4-9|=13+5=18

v14: |2-4| + |4-7|=2+3=5

Closer to v14.

So assignments for s2:

v11: v3

v14: v1, v2, v4, v5, v6, v7, v8, v9, v10

So sn_i for v11:1 user, v14:9 users.

Compute waiting time.

v11: cp=1, sn=1 →1/1=1 →1-4=-3 → wt=0

v14: cp=2, sn=9 →9/2=4.5 →4.5-4=0.5 →wt=(0.5)^2=0.25

Total wt=0 +0.25=0.25

Revenue: cf*10 - (6 +8)=100 -14=86

Compare the two solutions:

s1: wt=16, revenue=87

s2: wt=0.25, revenue=86

So s2 has much lower waiting time (0.25 vs 16) but slightly lower revenue (86 vs 87). Now, the problem says to pick the best solution. Since the objectives are to minimize waiting time and maximize revenue, we need to decide which solution is better. However, typically in multi-objective optimization, a solution is considered better if it is not dominated by another. A solution dominates another if it is better in at least one objective and not worse in the others. Here, s2 is better in waiting time but worse in revenue. So neither dominates the other. However, the problem statement says "the best solution" which implies there is a single best, so maybe there's a third solution s3 that wasn't listed. But in the reference solutions given, only s1 and s2 are provided. Wait, the user wrote "Reference solutions: s_1 selects... s_2 selects..." but the problem mentions five solutions (s1, s2, s3). Maybe a typo. Alternatively, maybe the user intended to list three solutions but only provided two. However, since only s1 and s2 are given, perhaps between these two, the answer is s2 because the waiting time is drastically lower with only a small decrease in revenue. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects to consider both objectives and pick the one that's better in the primary objective. The problem states the first objective is to minimize waiting time, the second to maximize revenue. If we are to prioritize the first objective, then s2 is better. However, sometimes objectives can be combined into a single metric, but the problem doesn't specify weights. Since the user says "the final output only includes the best solution", perhaps between s1 and s2, s2 is better because the significant improvement in waiting time outweighs the minor loss in revenue. Alternatively, if revenue is considered more important, but given that the first objective is listed first and the problem says "best solution", probably s2 is better.

Wait, but let me check if I did all calculations correctly.

For s2:

sn_i for v14 is 9 users. cp=2. So 9/2=4.5. 4.5 -4=0.5. Squared is 0.25. Correct.

Revenue: 10*10=100. Stations cost 6+8=14. 100-14=86. Correct.

s1: revenue 87, s2:86. So s1 has +1 revenue, but s2 has way lower waiting time. So depending on the decision maker's preference. If the goal is to minimize waiting time, s2 is better. If revenue is more important, s1 is better. But the problem statement says "the best solution according to the problem definition" which includes both objectives. However, without weights, we can't combine them. But in multi-objective optimization, the solutions that are Pareto optimal are considered. Here, s1 and s2 are both on the Pareto front if there's no other solution that's better in both. Since only these two are given, and the question is to pick the best from the given ones, it's possible that s2 is better because the waiting time is so much better with a small loss in revenue. However, the problem might have intended that the best solution is the one with higher revenue if the waiting time is acceptable. But since the problem statement lists the first objective as minimizing waiting time, perhaps that's considered more important. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects us to choose based on both objectives, but since they are conflicting, perhaps the user has another solution s3 which is better, but it's not given. However, given the options, s2 seems better in the primary objective. So I think the answer is s2.

The best solution is s_2.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

Objective Evaluation:

s₁ (v₁₁, v₁₂): Total waiting time = 16, Revenue = 87.

s₂ (v₁₁, v₁₄): Total waiting time = 0.25, Revenue = 86.

Comparison:

s₂ reduces waiting time drastically (0.25 vs. 16) at a minor cost to revenue (86 vs. 87).

The first objective (minimizing waiting time) is prioritized as per problem hierarchy, making s₂ superior despite marginally lower revenue.

Answer:
The best solution is s_2
