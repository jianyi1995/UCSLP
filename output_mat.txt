Okay, let me try to figure out which solution is better between s_1 and s_2 based on the problem definitions provided. The problem has two objectives: minimize the total waiting time (equation 5) and maximize the revenue (equation 6). So I need to evaluate both solutions on these two objectives and then decide which one is better.

First, let me recap the problem setup. There are 10 users (v1 to v10) and 4 possible charging stations (v11 to v14). Each charging station has a certain number of charging piles (cp_i) and running cost (c_i). The solutions s_1 and s_2 are different combinations of which stations are open.

For each solution, I need to determine which users are assigned to which stations (using equation 2), compute the number of users per station (sn_i), then calculate the waiting time for each station (equation 4), sum them up for the first objective. For the second objective, calculate the revenue which is (cf * number of users) minus the sum of running costs of open stations.

Let me start with s_1: z11=1, z12=1, z13=0, z14=0. So stations v11 and v12 are open. The other two are closed. Then s_2: z11=1, z12=0, z13=0, z14=1. So stations v11 and v14 are open.

First, I need to assign each user to their nearest open station in each solution. The coordinates are given for all users (v1 to v10) and stations (v11 to v14). Let me list all coordinates again to avoid confusion.

User coordinates (v1 to v10):

1. (10,5)

2. (9,3)

3. (12,10)

4. (4,3)

5. (7,10)

6. (0,11)

7. (7,1)

8. (1,0)

9. (8,9)

10. (2,4)

Station coordinates (v11 to v14):

11. (15,9)

12. (7,12)

13. (15,14)

14. (4,7)

For s_1, open stations are v11 (15,9) and v12 (7,12). For s_2, open stations are v11 (15,9) and v14 (4,7).

Let me compute the Manhattan distance from each user to the open stations in each solution.

Starting with solution s_1 (v11 and v12 open):

For each user v1 to v10, compute distance to v11 and v12, choose the smaller one. Then assign to the nearest. Then count how many users each station serves (sn_i), then compute waiting time wt_i.

Let me do this step by step.

User v1: (10,5)

Distance to v11 (15,9): |10-15| + |5-9| = 5 + 4 = 9

Distance to v12 (7,12): |10-7| + |5-12| = 3 + 7 = 10

So v1 is assigned to v11 (smaller distance 9).

User v2: (9,3)

v11: |9-15| + |3-9| = 6 + 6 = 12

v12: |9-7| + |3-12| = 2 + 9 = 11

So v2 is assigned to v12.

User v3: (12,10)

v11: |12-15| + |10-9| = 3 +1=4

v12: |12-7| + |10-12|=5 +2=7

So v3 to v11.

User v4: (4,3)

v11: |4-15| + |3-9| = 11 +6=17

v12: |4-7| + |3-12|=3 +9=12

v4 assigned to v12.

User v5: (7,10)

v11: |7-15| + |10-9|=8 +1=9

v12: |7-7| + |10-12|=0 +2=2

So v5 to v12.

User v6: (0,11)

v11: |0-15| + |11-9|=15 +2=17

v12: |0-7| + |11-12|=7 +1=8

v6 to v12.

User v7: (7,1)

v11: |7-15| + |1-9|=8 +8=16

v12: |7-7| + |1-12|=0 +11=11

v7 to v12.

User v8: (1,0)

v11: |1-15| + |0-9|=14 +9=23

v12: |1-7| + |0-12|=6 +12=18

v8 to v12.

User v9: (8,9)

v11: |8-15| + |9-9|=7 +0=7

v12: |8-7| + |9-12|=1 +3=4

v9 to v12.

User v10: (2,4)

v11: |2-15| + |4-9|=13 +5=18

v12: |2-7| + |4-12|=5 +8=13

v10 to v12.

Now, let's count how many users each station serves in s_1.

v11: users v1, v3 → 2 users.

v12: users v2, v4, v5, v6, v7, v8, v9, v10 → 8 users.

Now compute waiting time for each station. The formula is wt_i = [max(0, (sn_i / cp_i) - (24 / t)]². Given that t=360 (charging time), so 24 hours / 360 hours per charge. Wait, charging time t is 360 minutes? Or hours? Wait, the problem says "charging time t=360". Hmm, but the formula in equation 4: 24 is the number of hours in a day. So perhaps t is in hours? Wait, if the charging time is 360 hours, that's 15 days, which doesn't make sense. Maybe t is in minutes? So 360 minutes is 6 hours. Then 24 / t would be 24 hours divided by 6 hours per charge, which is 4. So the term 24/t is the number of charges a pile can handle per day. Because if a charge takes t hours, then in 24 hours, each pile can do 24/t charges. So for example, if t is 6 hours, then each pile can handle 4 charges per day. If the number of users per station (sn_i) divided by the number of piles (cp_i) exceeds 4, then the waiting time squared is computed.

But let's confirm units. If t is given as 360, and the problem says "charging time", maybe t is in minutes. 360 minutes is 6 hours. Then 24 hours is 24*60=1440 minutes. So 1440 / 360 = 4. So each pile can handle 4 charges per day. Therefore, if the number of users per pile (sn_i / cp_i) exceeds 4, there's a waiting time. The formula is [max(0, (sn_i / cp_i) - (24 / t))]^2. Wait, but 24/t where t is in hours would make sense if t is in hours. But the problem didn't specify. However, the problem statement says "charging time t=360", and the formula (4) uses 24 as hours. So perhaps t is in hours? Then 24/t would be 24/360 = 0.066..., which would be strange. Wait, that can't be. Let me check.

Wait, the problem says "charging time t=360". If t is in minutes, then converting 24 hours to minutes gives 1440. So 1440 / 360 = 4. That makes sense. So if each charge takes 360 minutes (6 hours), each pile can handle 4 charges per day. So (sn_i / cp_i) is the average number of users per pile. If that's more than 4, there's a waiting time. So the formula is (max(0, (sn_i / cp_i) - 4))^2.

Therefore, for each station, compute (sn_i / cp_i) - 4. If positive, square it for wt_i.

Now, in s_1:

v11 has sn_i=2, cp_i=1 (from the data: cp for v11 is 1, running cost 6). So (2/1) -4 = 2 -4 = -2. So max(0, -2) =0. So wt_i=0²=0.

v12 has sn_i=8, cp_i=1. So (8/1) -4=8-4=4. So max(0,4)=4. So wt_i=4²=16.

Total waiting time for s_1 is 0 +16=16.

For the revenue (equation 6): cf * |V^U| - sum(z_i * c_i). cf=10, |V^U|=10. So 10*10=100. Then subtract the sum of c_i for open stations. In s_1, open stations are v11 (c=6) and v12 (c=7). So total cost is 6+7=13. Revenue is 100 -13=87.

Now for solution s_2: open stations v11 and v14. So stations v11 (15,9) and v14 (4,7).

Compute assignments for each user to nearest open station.

User v1: (10,5)

Distance to v11 (15,9): 5 +4=9.

Distance to v14 (4,7): |10-4| + |5-7|=6 +2=8.

So v1 is closer to v14 (distance 8 vs 9). Assign to v14.

User v2: (9,3)

v11: |9-15| + |3-9|=6+6=12.

v14: |9-4| + |3-7|=5+4=9.

v2 assigned to v14.

User v3: (12,10)

v11: |12-15| + |10-9|=3+1=4.

v14: |12-4| + |10-7|=8+3=11.

v3 to v11.

User v4: (4,3)

v11: |4-15| + |3-9|=11+6=17.

v14: |4-4| + |3-7|=0+4=4.

v4 to v14.

User v5: (7,10)

v11: |7-15| + |10-9|=8+1=9.

v14: |7-4| + |10-7|=3+3=6.

v5 to v14.

User v6: (0,11)

v11: |0-15| + |11-9|=15+2=17.

v14: |0-4| + |11-7|=4+4=8.

v6 to v14.

User v7: (7,1)

v11: |7-15| + |1-9|=8+8=16.

v14: |7-4| + |1-7|=3+6=9.

v7 to v14.

User v8: (1,0)

v11: |1-15| + |0-9|=14+9=23.

v14: |1-4| + |0-7|=3+7=10.

v8 to v14.

User v9: (8,9)

v11: |8-15| + |9-9|=7+0=7.

v14: |8-4| + |9-7|=4+2=6.

v9 to v14.

User v10: (2,4)

v11: |2-15| + |4-9|=13+5=18.

v14: |2-4| + |4-7|=2+3=5.

v10 to v14.

Now count sn_i for s_2:

v11: user v3 →1 user.

v14: users v1, v2, v4, v5, v6, v7, v8, v9, v10 →9 users.

Now compute waiting time.

For v11: sn_i=1, cp_i=1. (1/1 -4)=1-4=-3 → max(0,-3)=0. wt=0.

v14: sn_i=9, cp_i=2 (from the data: cp for v14 is 2, running cost 8). So (9/2)-4=4.5-4=0.5. So max(0,0.5)=0.5. wt_i=(0.5)^2=0.25.

Total waiting time for s_2 is 0 +0.25=0.25.

Revenue for s_2: 10*10=100. Open stations are v11 (c=6) and v14 (c=8). Total cost 6+8=14. Revenue 100-14=86.

Comparing the two solutions:

s_1: total waiting time 16, revenue 87.

s_2: total waiting time 0.25, revenue 86.

The problem states that we need to pick the best solution according to the problem definition, which has two objectives: minimize waiting time and maximize revenue. However, it's not specified whether these objectives are weighted equally or if one takes priority. In multi-objective optimization, there isn't a single "best" solution unless one solution dominates the other in all objectives. Here, s_2 has a much lower waiting time (0.25 vs 16), but slightly lower revenue (86 vs 87). Since the problem doesn't specify how to trade-off between the two objectives, but typically, if one solution is better in one objective and worse in another, they are considered non-dominated. However, the problem says "the best solution", implying there's a way to compare them. Maybe the problem expects us to consider both objectives but prioritize one over the other. For example, maybe the first objective (waiting time) is the primary one since it's listed first, or perhaps they are combined in a certain way.

However, since the user asks to pick the best solution from the given two, and the reference solutions are s_1 and s_2, we need to decide based on both objectives. If the goal is to minimize waiting time and maximize revenue, then s_2 is much better in waiting time but slightly worse in revenue. Depending on the decision maker's preference, a significant improvement in waiting time might be worth a small decrease in revenue. In many cases, especially public service, waiting time is critical. Since the waiting time in s_2 is 0.25 compared to 16 in s_1, which is a massive difference, while the revenue difference is only 1 (87 vs 86), s_2 is likely the better solution. However, the problem might have a specific way of combining the objectives, but since it's not mentioned, we have to use dominance.

But wait, in multi-objective terms, s_2 is better in one objective and worse in another. So neither solution dominates the other. However, the problem might consider a weighted sum or prioritize one objective over the other. Since the problem statement lists the first objective as minimizing waiting time and the second as maximizing revenue. If we have to choose based on both, but there's no further info, perhaps we can consider the magnitude of differences. The waiting time difference is huge (16 vs 0.25), while the revenue difference is minor (87 vs 86). Therefore, s_2 is better overall.

Alternatively, the problem might require considering both objectives but gives priority to the first one (minimizing waiting time). In that case, since s_2 is better in the first objective, it's preferred.

Alternatively, maybe the problem wants us to check if one solution is better in both objectives. If not, then which one is better based on the problem's context. But given that the waiting time is drastically better in s_2 with a small loss in revenue, s_2 is likely the better choice.

The best solution is s_2: {z_{v_11} = 1, z_{v_12}=0, z_{v_13}=0, z_{v_14}=1}.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

Objective Evaluation for s₁:

Waiting Time (∑wtᵢ): 0 (v₁₁) + 16 (v₁₂) = 16

Revenue: 10×10 - (6+7) = 100 - 13 = 87

Objective Evaluation for s₂:

Waiting Time (∑wtᵢ): 0 (v₁₁) + 0.25 (v₁₄) = 0.25

Revenue: 10×10 - (6+8) = 100 - 14 = 86

Comparison:

s₂ reduces waiting time by 15.75 (from 16 to 0.25) but decreases revenue by 1 (from 87 to 86). The significant improvement in waiting time outweighs the minor revenue loss, prioritizing service efficiency.

Final Answer:
The best solution is \boxed{s_2}.
