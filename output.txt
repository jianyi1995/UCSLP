Okay, let's see. I need to pick the best solution from s1 to s5 based on the problem's two objectives: minimizing the total waiting time and maximizing the revenue. Let me break this down step by step.

First, let me recap the problem. We have 10 users (v1 to v10) and 4 possible charging stations (v11 to v14). Each solution selects a subset of these stations. The two objectives are conflicting, so I need to evaluate each solution on both and see which one is the best trade-off.

The first objective is to minimize the sum of waiting times, which is calculated using equation (4). The waiting time for a station is (max(0, (sn_i / cp_i) - (24 / t)))^2. Here, sn_i is the number of users assigned to station i, cp_i is the number of charging piles, and t is the charging time (60 minutes). So 24/t is 24 hours divided by 1 hour per charge, meaning each pile can handle 24 charges per day. So if sn_i / cp_i exceeds 24, then there's a waiting time. Otherwise, it's zero. Then square that value.

The second objective is to maximize the revenue, which is cf * number of users (which is 10*10=100) minus the sum of running costs of the selected stations. So revenue = 100 - sum(c_i for selected stations). So higher revenue is better.

But how do I compare solutions with different trade-offs between these two objectives? Since the problem doesn't specify weights or a method to combine them, maybe we need to look for a Pareto optimal solution. However, the problem says to pick the best solution, which implies there's a single best one. Perhaps one solution is better in both objectives, or maybe there's a way to calculate a combined score.

Wait, but the problem says "pick the best solution according to the problem definition". The problem definition has two objectives: minimize (5) and maximize (6). Since they are separate objectives, unless there's a priority given (like lex order), but the problem doesn't mention that. Hmm. Maybe the user expects us to evaluate based on both objectives and determine which solution is non-dominated. However, the final answer should only include the best solution.

But perhaps the solutions are given as possible candidates, and the best one is the one that's Pareto optimal. Let's check each solution's objectives and see which ones are not dominated by others.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects to calculate both objectives for each solution and then choose the one with the best trade-off. Let's proceed by computing both objectives for each solution.

First, I need to figure out for each solution (s1 to s5), which stations are selected. Then, for each selected station, assign the users to their closest station (according to Manhattan distance). Then compute sn_i (number of users per station), then compute wt_i for each station, sum them for the first objective. Then compute revenue (100 - sum(c_i)) for the second objective.

So the key is to figure out, for each solution's selected stations, how the users are assigned (cs_i), which affects sn_i, and thus wt_i and revenue.

But to compute this, I need the coordinates of all the users and stations. The instance gives coordinates from v1 to v14, but the actual coordinates are listed as "(10,5), (9,3), …, (4,7)". Wait, but the problem says "Coordinates from v_1 to v_14 are: (10,5), (9,3), …, (4,7)". So each node from v1 to v14 has coordinates. But in the problem instance, the example lists 14 coordinates? But since the user provided an example with "...", maybe in the actual case, the coordinates are provided, but here we need to proceed with the given data. However, in the problem as presented here, the coordinates after v1 and v2 are omitted and replaced with "...", and the last coordinate is (4,7). But this is a problem because without knowing all coordinates, we can't compute Manhattan distances between users and stations. Wait, but perhaps in the original problem given to the reference solutions, the coordinates were fully specified. But since the user hasn't provided all coordinates here, but the reference solutions (s1 to s5) are given, maybe the solutions are based on some specific assignment of users to stations. Wait, but this seems impossible. How can I compute the assignment without coordinates?

Wait, perhaps the reference solutions already have the assignments computed, and the user is expecting me to assume that the solutions' assignments are already determined. But no, the problem requires evaluating the solutions based on the given instance, but the instance's coordinates are incomplete here. This is a problem. Wait, maybe the user is presenting a simplified version, and perhaps the actual calculations were done with the given coordinates. But since in this question, we are to pick from s1 to s5, perhaps the answer is determined by knowing which of these solutions gives the optimal balance between the two objectives, based on the station parameters (cp_i and c_i) and the number of users assigned.

But without the exact coordinates, how can we determine how many users each station would get? For example, if a solution selects stations with more charging piles (like v13 and v14, which have 2 each), then they can handle more users without exceeding the capacity (since sn_i / cp_i would be lower). However, the actual assignment depends on the distances. But since the coordinates are not given here, we can't compute the actual assignments. Therefore, this seems like an oversight. But since the reference solutions are given (s1 to s5), maybe the correct answer is known based on typical parameters, like station capacities and running costs.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is structured such that even without knowing the exact coordinates, some solutions can be eliminated. For example, let's look at the parameters of the stations:

v11: cp=1, c=6

v12: cp=1, c=7

v13: cp=2, c=13

v14: cp=2, c=8

So, the stations with more charging piles (v13, v14) can handle more users, which would reduce waiting time. But their running costs are higher (v13 is 13, v14 is 8). So selecting v14 is cheaper than v13 but has the same cp. So perhaps solutions that include v14 are better.

Looking at the solutions:

s1: v11, v12 (both cp=1, total c=6+7=13)

s2: v11, v13 (c=6+13=19)

s3: v12, v13 (c=7+13=20)

s4: v13, v14 (c=13+8=21)

s5: v11, v14 (c=6+8=14)

Now, for the revenue (second objective), which is 100 - sum(c_i). So higher is better.

So revenues:

s1: 100 -13=87

s2: 100-19=81

s3:100-20=80

s4:100-21=79

s5:100-14=86

So in terms of revenue, s1 is best (87), then s5 (86), then s2 (81), s3 (80), s4 (79). So s1 gives the highest revenue.

But what about the first objective, total waiting time? Let's think. The waiting time depends on how many users are assigned to each station. If stations with more charging piles (v13, v14) are selected, they can handle more users without exceeding 24 charges per day (since sn_i / cp_i <=24). Because each charging pile can handle 24 users per day (since t=60 minutes, so 1 per hour, 24 per day). So sn_i / cp_i should be <=24, otherwise waiting time occurs.

But there are 10 users. So each user needs to be assigned to a station. If a station has cp=1, then sn_i /1 <=24 → sn_i <=24. Since there are only 10 users, even a single charging pile can handle all 10 users (10/1=10 <=24), so waiting time would be zero. Wait, that's not possible. Wait, the waiting time formula is (max(0, (sn_i / cp_i) - (24/t)))^2. Wait, t is 60 minutes, which is 1 hour. So 24/t would be 24/1=24. So (sn_i / cp_i) -24. If sn_i / cp_i exceeds 24, then the waiting time is squared. But if sn_i / cp_i is less than or equal to 24, then the max(0,...) is zero, so wt_i=0.

Wait, but t is the charging time. Wait, the charging time is 60 minutes per user. So each charging pile can process 24 users per day (since 24 hours / 1 hour per user). Therefore, for a station i with cp_i charging piles, the total capacity per day is cp_i *24. The number of users assigned to it (sn_i) must be <= cp_i *24 to have no waiting time. Since there are only 10 users in total, even a single charging pile can handle 24 users, which is more than enough. Therefore, sn_i / cp_i will always be <=10/1=10 <=24. Therefore, the waiting time for all stations would be zero. But that can't be right. Wait, this seems like a mistake. Let me check the formula again.

The formula for waiting time is wt_i = [max(0, (sn_i / cp_i) - (24 / t))]^2.

Wait, t is the charging time. So t=60 minutes =1 hour. So 24/t is 24 hours / 1 hour per charge =24. So the term is (sn_i / cp_i) -24. If sn_i / cp_i >24, then the difference is positive, else zero. But sn_i is the number of users served by station i. Since there are only 10 users total, sn_i can be at most 10. So sn_i / cp_i would be 10/cp_i. For cp_i=1, that's 10; for cp_i=2, 5. Both are less than 24. Therefore, (10/1) -24= -14, so max(0, -14)=0. Therefore, waiting time is zero for all stations. Then the first objective (sum of wt_i) would be zero for all solutions. But that can't be the case. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the formula.

Wait, the charging time t=60 minutes. The charging time per user is 1 hour. A charging pile can handle 24 users per day (since 24 hours /1 hour per user). Therefore, the capacity per station is cp_i *24 users per day. If the number of users assigned to a station (sn_i) is less than or equal to cp_i *24, then there's no waiting time. Otherwise, waiting time occurs. But since we have only 10 users total, even if all 10 are assigned to a single station with cp=1, sn_i=10 <=24, so waiting time is zero. Therefore, all solutions would have sum(wt_i)=0. But that's not possible because then the first objective is the same for all solutions. But the problem mentions that the two objectives are (5) and (6), so maybe there's a mistake in interpreting the formula.

Wait, maybe the formula is (max(0, (sn_i / cp_i) - (24 / (t /60))) ). Wait, if t is in minutes, then 24 hours is 24*60=1440 minutes. So 1440 / t =1440/60=24. So same as before. So the same result. Therefore, with t=60, the threshold is 24. But since sn_i can't exceed 10, which is less than 24 for any cp_i (since cp_i is at least 1), then wt_i is always zero. Therefore, all solutions have the same first objective (sum wt_i=0), so the best solution is the one with the highest revenue. Then s1 has revenue 87, s5 has 86, so s1 is best. But that seems too straightforward. Also, in that case, all solutions would have the first objective equal, so the second objective becomes the deciding factor. Then s1 is the best. But maybe I'm missing something here.

Alternatively, maybe the formula is supposed to be (sn_i / (cp_i * (24 / t))). For example, if the charging time is t hours, then in 24 hours, each pile can handle 24/t users. Therefore, the capacity is cp_i * (24/t). If sn_i exceeds that, then waiting time occurs. Wait, the problem defines the waiting time as:

wt_i = [max(0, (sn_i / cp_i) - (24 / t))]^2

But if t is in hours, then 24/t would be 24 divided by the charging time per user in hours. Wait, but t is given as 60, which is 60 minutes, so 1 hour. Then 24/t is 24/1=24. So again, same as before. So if sn_i / cp_i <=24, then wt_i=0. But sn_i is at most 10, and cp_i is at least 1, so 10/1=10 <=24. Therefore, all solutions have sum wt_i=0. So the first objective is the same for all, so we choose the one with highest revenue, which is s1 (87).

But this seems counterintuitive. Maybe the problem intended t to be in hours, but then t=60 would mean 60 hours, which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe there's a mistake in the problem's formula. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is (sn_i / cp_i) * t -24, but that's not what's written.

Alternatively, perhaps the waiting time is calculated per hour? Wait, the problem states that the total waiting time wt_i of each station is defined as in equation (4), which is [max(0, (sn_i / cp_i) - (24 / t))]^2. Maybe there's a unit inconsistency here. Let's think: sn_i is the number of users served by station i. cp_i is the number of charging piles. 24 is the number of hours in a day. t is the charging time in hours. Then 24/t would be the number of users each pile can serve per day. For example, if t=1 hour, each pile can serve 24 users per day. So the capacity per station is cp_i * (24/t). If sn_i exceeds that, then there's a waiting time. Therefore, the formula should be max(0, sn_i - cp_i*(24/t)) , but that's not what's given. The given formula is (sn_i / cp_i) - (24/t). Which would be (users per pile) - (number of users per pile that can be served in a day). If that's positive, there's a waiting time.

Wait, let's plug in t=60 minutes, which is 1 hour. Then 24/t =24/1=24. So the formula becomes (sn_i / cp_i) -24. For example, if a station has cp_i=1 and sn_i=25, then (25/1)-24=1, so waiting time is 1^2=1. But in our case, sn_i can't exceed 10, so (10/1)-24= -14, so waiting time is zero. Therefore, all solutions have sum wt_i=0, making the first objective irrelevant, and the decision is based solely on revenue. Hence, s1 is the best with revenue 87.

But the problem mentions both objectives, so this seems odd. Maybe there's a miscalculation. Let me check the problem statement again.

Problem statement:

Charging time t=60 (units not specified, but given the formula, probably in minutes). The charging fee cf=10.

The waiting time formula:

wt_i = [max(0, (sn_i / cp_i) - (24 / t))]^2.

If t is in minutes, then 24 (hours) converted to minutes is 24*60=1440 minutes. Then 1440 / t =1440/60=24. So same result. So regardless of units, as long as t is 60 minutes (1 hour), 24/t=24. Therefore, the same conclusion: sn_i / cp_i can't exceed 24, so all solutions have wt_i=0. Hence, the first objective is zero for all, and the best solution is s1 with highest revenue.

But that seems too simple. The reference solutions might be designed under a different interpretation. For example, if t is in hours, but written as 60, which would be 60 hours, which is unreasonable. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is supposed to be (sn_i / (cp_i * t)) compared to 24. For example, total charging time required is sn_i * t, and the available time is 24 hours * cp_i. So if (sn_i * t) > (24 * cp_i), then there's waiting time. But the problem's formula is different.

Alternatively, maybe the problem intended t to be in hours, but t=60 is 60 hours, which is 2.5 days, which is impossible. That can't be. So this suggests that maybe the problem has a mistake, but given the data, the conclusion is that all solutions have zero waiting time, so revenue is the only objective.

Therefore, the best solution is s1 with revenue 87.

But wait, let's check the problem statement again. The charging time is t and is given as 60. If t is 60 hours, that would be 2.5 days, which is impossible. Therefore, t must be 60 minutes, i.e., 1 hour. Therefore, the analysis holds.

Thus, according to this, s1 is the best solution. However, let's check the possible reference solutions. The solutions are:

s1: v11, v12 (total cost 6+7=13, revenue 87)

s5: v11, v14 (6+8=14, revenue 86)

So s1 is better in revenue. However, maybe in the actual problem, the waiting time isn't zero for all solutions. Perhaps there's a miscalculation. Alternatively, maybe the formula is different. For example, if the waiting time is calculated as (sn_i / (cp_i * (24 / (t/60)))).

Wait, t=60 minutes=1 hour. So 24 hours / (t hours) =24 /1=24. So per pile, 24 users per day. So capacity is cp_i *24. If sn_i exceeds cp_i*24, then waiting time. But sn_i is up to 10. So no. Therefore, the waiting time is zero.

Alternatively, maybe the problem's formula is supposed to be (sn_i / (cp_i * t)) compared to 24. For example, if t is in hours, sn_i is the number of users, cp_i is the number of piles. So total time needed is sn_i * t hours. Total available time per station is 24 * cp_i hours. If sn_i * t >24 * cp_i, then there's waiting time. The excess time is (sn_i * t -24 * cp_i). But the problem's formula is (sn_i / cp_i -24/t)^2.

Wait, let's compute:

If the total time required is sn_i * t (minutes). The total available time per station is 24*60*cp_i minutes. Then, if sn_i * t >24*60*cp_i, then there's a waiting time. But the problem's formula is:

wt_i = [max(0, (sn_i / cp_i) - (24 / t))]^2.

Let's plug t=60 minutes:

24 / t =24/60=0.4.

Then, (sn_i / cp_i) -0.4. If this is positive, square it. For example, if a station has sn_i=10 and cp_i=1, then 10/1 -0.4=9.6>0, so wt_i=(9.6)^2=92.16. This would make the waiting time significant. But this seems more plausible. Ah! Perhaps there's a mistake in the interpretation of t's units. If t is in hours, but the problem states t=60 (minutes), then we need to convert t to hours. For example, t=60 minutes=1 hour. Then 24/t=24/1=24. But if the formula is intended to have t in hours, but t is given as 60 (minutes), then perhaps there's a unit conversion error. Let's clarify:

If t is in hours, then 24/t is 24 divided by the charging time per user in hours. For example, if a user takes 1 hour to charge (t=1), then 24/t=24, so each pile can handle 24 users per day. If the charging time is 2 hours (t=2), then 24/2=12 users per pile per day.

But in the problem, t=60, which is likely 60 minutes, i.e., 1 hour. Therefore, 24/t=24/1=24. So if the formula is (sn_i / cp_i) -24, and sn_i is 10, then 10/1 -24= -14, so waiting time is zero.

But if the problem intended t to be in minutes, then 24 hours is 1440 minutes. Then 1440 / t =1440/60=24. So same result. Therefore, regardless of units, the threshold is 24. Since sn_i is at most 10, which is less than 24*cp_i (even for cp_i=1, 24*1=24), so waiting time is zero.

But this would make the first objective irrelevant, which is unlikely. The problem must have intended something else. Let me re-examine the problem statement.

The problem says: "The total waiting time wt_i of each station i is defined in (4), where 24 is the number of hours in a day. The first objective function is to minimize the waiting time of charging electric vehicles presented in (5)."

Equation (4): wt_i = [max(0, (sn_i / cp_i) - (24 / t))]^2.

Wait, perhaps there's a typo in the formula. Maybe it's supposed to be (sn_i / (cp_i * (24 / t))) ?

For example, if each charging pile can process (24 / t) users per day, then total capacity is cp_i * (24/t). If sn_i exceeds that, then waiting time. But the way the formula is written is (sn_i / cp_i) - (24/t). Which is equivalent to (sn_i - cp_i*(24/t)) / cp_i.

But regardless, if t=60 (minutes), then 24/t (hours?) No, t is in minutes. 24 hours is 1440 minutes. 1440 / t =1440/60=24. So again, same threshold.

So if a station has cp_i=1, then it can handle 24 users per day. With sn_i=10, which is less than 24, so waiting time zero.

Thus, all solutions have sum wt_i=0, so the first objective is the same for all. Then the best solution is the one with the highest revenue, which is s1 (revenue 87). But this contradicts the idea that there are two objectives. Therefore, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem's formula, or perhaps the given instance has more users than the capacity, but in this case, there are only 10 users.

Alternatively, maybe the problem intended t to represent the number of hours required to charge a vehicle, but t=60 would mean 60 hours, which is impossible. So perhaps there's a mistake in the problem's data.

Given the information provided, and assuming the problem's data is correct, the only logical conclusion is that all solutions have zero waiting time, so the best solution is s1 with the highest revenue. Therefore, the answer is s1.

But wait, looking at the solutions:

s4 selects v13 and v14. These have cp=2 each. So total cp=4. sn_i for each would be, say, split between them. But even if all 10 users went to one station, sn_i/cp_i=10/2=5 <24, so wt_i=0. So yes, all solutions have zero waiting time.

Hence, the best solution is s1, as it has the highest revenue.

The best solution is s₁, which selects charging stations v₁₁ and v₁₂. This choice maximizes the revenue (87) while ensuring no waiting time (as all solutions have zero waiting time due to sufficient capacity).

Step-by-Step Explanation:

Waiting Time Calculation: For each station, wt_i = [max(0, (sn_i/cp_i - 24/t)]². Given t=60 (1 hour), 24/t=24. Since sn_i ≤10 and cp_i ≥1, sn_i/cp_i ≤10 <24, so wt_i=0 for all stations. Thus, all solutions have ∑wt_i=0.

Revenue Calculation: Revenue = 10*10 - Σc_i. s₁ has the lowest total cost (6+7=13), yielding the highest revenue (100-13=87).

Answer:
The best solution is s1.
