Okay, let's try to figure out which solution is better between s_1 and s_2 based on the problem definitions provided. The problem has two objectives: minimizing the total waiting time (equation 5) and maximizing the revenue (equation 6). But since they are two different objectives, I need to see which solution balances them better or if one clearly dominates the other.

First, let me recall what each solution does.

s_1 selects charging stations v_11 and v_12. The first objective (total waiting time) is 16, and the second (revenue) is 87.

s_2 selects v_11 and v_14, with a waiting time of 0.25 and revenue of 86.

So the first thing I notice is that s_2 has a much lower total waiting time (0.25 vs. 16) but a slightly lower revenue (86 vs. 87). So there's a trade-off here: s_2 is better on the first objective but slightly worse on the second. The problem is to pick the best solution according to the problem definition. But how do we compare these two? The problem statement says "best solution", but doesn't specify if one objective is prioritized over the other. However, typically in multi-objective optimization, a solution is considered better if it dominates another, meaning it is better in at least one objective and not worse in the others. If that's not the case, then it depends on the decision maker's preference, which isn't given here.

But maybe the problem expects us to consider both objectives with some implicit priority. Let's check the problem statement again. The first objective is to minimize the waiting time, and the second is to maximize revenue. But the problem says "the best solution", so perhaps the user expects a solution that's better in both, but in this case, neither solution is strictly better than the other. So maybe there's another way to compare them.

Alternatively, maybe the problem wants us to use a specific method to combine the two objectives, but that's not mentioned. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects that since the first objective is a minimization and the second a maximization, we need to see which solution offers a better trade-off. For instance, s_2 has a huge improvement in waiting time (from 16 to 0.25) but only loses 1 in revenue. That seems like a good trade-off. But I need to verify if the calculations are correct.

Wait, let me make sure that the given objective values for s_1 and s_2 are accurate. Because if there's a mistake in the numbers, that would affect the decision.

Let me recalculate the waiting time and revenue for both solutions to verify.

First, for s_1: selects v_11 and v_12. Each has cp_i (charging piles) and c_i (running cost). From the data:

v_11: cp=1, c=6

v_12: cp=1, c=7

v_13: cp=2, c=13

v_14: cp=2, c=8

s_1 has z_11=1, z_12=1, z_13=0, z_14=0.

Then, each user (v1 to v10) is assigned to the nearest open charging station (v11 or v12). Let's compute the assignments.

First, list all the coordinates:

V^U: v1(10,5), v2(9,3), v3(12,10), v4(4,3), v5(7,10), v6(0,11), v7(7,1), v8(1,0), v9(8,9), v10(2,4)

V^S: v11(15,9), v12(7,12), v13(15,14), v14(4,7)

Wait, s_1 is using v11 and v12. So the open stations are v11 at (15,9) and v12 at (7,12). Each user will choose the nearest between these two.

Compute Manhattan distance from each user to v11 and v12.

v1 (10,5) to v11 (15,9): |10-15| + |5-9| = 5 +4=9

v1 to v12 (7,12): |10-7| + |5-12| =3 +7=10. So v1 is assigned to v11.

v2 (9,3) to v11: |9-15| + |3-9| =6 +6=12; to v12: |9-7| + |3-12|=2 +9=11. So v2 assigned to v12.

v3 (12,10) to v11: |12-15| + |10-9|=3+1=4; to v12: |12-7| + |10-12|=5+2=7. So v3 to v11.

v4 (4,3) to v11: |4-15| + |3-9|=11+6=17; to v12: |4-7| + |3-12|=3+9=12. So v4 to v12.

v5 (7,10) to v11: |7-15| + |10-9|=8+1=9; to v12 (7,12): |7-7| + |10-12|=0+2=2. So v5 to v12.

v6 (0,11) to v11: |0-15| + |11-9|=15+2=17; to v12 (7,12): |0-7| + |11-12|=7+1=8. So v6 to v12.

v7 (7,1) to v11: |7-15| + |1-9|=8+8=16; to v12 (7,12): |7-7| + |1-12|=0+11=11. So v7 to v12.

v8 (1,0) to v11: |1-15| + |0-9|=14+9=23; to v12: |1-7| + |0-12|=6+12=18. So v8 to v12.

v9 (8,9) to v11: |8-15| + |9-9|=7+0=7; to v12 (7,12): |8-7| + |9-12|=1 +3=4. So v9 to v12.

v10 (2,4) to v11: |2-15| + |4-9|=13+5=18; to v12: |2-7| + |4-12|=5+8=13. So v10 to v12.

So the assignments:

v11 gets v1 and v3. So sn_11 = 2.

v12 gets v2, v4, v5, v6, v7, v8, v9, v10. That's 8 users.

Now, compute waiting time for each station. The formula is wt_i = [max(0, (sn_i / cp_i) - (24/t)]². Since t=360, 24/t = 24/360 = 0.066666... hours per day? Wait, maybe units need to be checked. Wait, the charging time t is given as 360, but units aren't specified. Maybe 360 minutes (which is 6 hours) or 360 hours (but that's 15 days, which doesn't make sense). The problem statement mentions "charging time t and charging fee cf". Let me check the formula again.

In equation (4), the waiting time is calculated as [max(0, (sn_i / cp_i) - (24/t))]^2. So the units here: sn_i is number of users served by station i. cp_i is number of charging piles. So sn_i / cp_i is the number of users per pile. 24 is hours in a day. t is charging time. So perhaps t is in hours. Then 24/t would be the number of times a charging pile can be used per day. For example, if t=2 hours, a pile can serve 12 users per day. So sn_i / cp_i is the number of users per pile, and 24/t is the maximum number of users per pile that can be served in a day without waiting. If sn_i/cp_i exceeds 24/t, then there's a waiting time squared.

But given t=360, if t is in minutes, 360 minutes is 6 hours. Then 24/t (in hours) would be 24 hours / 6 hours per charge = 4. So each pile can serve 4 users per day. So if sn_i/cp_i >4, then waiting time occurs. The waiting time per station is ( (sn_i/cp_i -4 ) )².

So for s_1:

v11: sn=2, cp=1. So sn/cp=2. 2 -4 = negative, so max(0, -2)=0. So wt_11=0²=0.

v12: sn=8, cp=1. So sn/cp=8. 8 -4=4. So wt_i=(4)^2=16. Total waiting time is 0+16=16. That matches the given value for s_1.

Revenue for s_1: cf * |V^U| - sum(z_i * c_i). |V^U|=10 users. cf=10. So 10*10=100. Sum of running costs: v11 (6) + v12 (7) =13. So 100-13=87. That's correct.

Now check s_2: selects v11 and v14.

v11 is at (15,9), v14 is at (4,7).

Assign each user to the nearest of these two.

Compute Manhattan distances:

v1 (10,5):

To v11 (15,9): |10-15| + |5-9| =5+4=9

To v14 (4,7): |10-4| + |5-7|=6+2=8. So v1 to v14.

v2 (9,3):

To v11: |9-15| + |3-9|=6+6=12

To v14: |9-4| + |3-7|=5+4=9. So v2 to v14.

v3 (12,10):

To v11: |12-15| + |10-9|=3+1=4

To v14: |12-4| + |10-7|=8+3=11. So v3 to v11.

v4 (4,3):

To v11: |4-15| + |3-9|=11+6=17

To v14: |4-4| + |3-7|=0+4=4. So v4 to v14.

v5 (7,10):

To v11: |7-15| + |10-9|=8+1=9

To v14: |7-4| + |10-7|=3+3=6. So v5 to v14.

v6 (0,11):

To v11: |0-15| + |11-9|=15+2=17

To v14: |0-4| + |11-7|=4+4=8. So v6 to v14.

v7 (7,1):

To v11: |7-15| + |1-9|=8+8=16

To v14: |7-4| + |1-7|=3+6=9. So v7 to v14.

v8 (1,0):

To v11: |1-15| + |0-9|=14+9=23

To v14: |1-4| + |0-7|=3+7=10. So v8 to v14.

v9 (8,9):

To v11: |8-15| + |9-9|=7+0=7

To v14: |8-4| + |9-7|=4+2=6. So v9 to v14.

v10 (2,4):

To v11: |2-15| + |4-9|=13+5=18

To v14: |2-4| + |4-7|=2+3=5. So v10 to v14.

So assignments:

v11 gets v3 (1 user)

v14 gets v1, v2, v4, v5, v6, v7, v8, v9, v10 (9 users)

Now compute waiting time:

v11: sn=1, cp=1. So sn/cp=1. 1 - (24/360) ? Wait, wait, earlier I thought 24/t was 24 divided by t in hours. Let's clarify. The charging time t is given as 360. If t is in minutes, then 360 minutes = 6 hours. Then 24 hours / 6 hours per charge = 4, meaning each pile can handle 4 charges per day. If t is in hours, then 360 hours is 15 days, which doesn't make sense. So t must be in minutes. Therefore, t=360 minutes = 6 hours. Therefore, 24/t = 24 hours /6 hours per charge =4. So as before.

So for each station:

v11: sn=1, cp=1. 1/1=1. 1-4= -3. max(0,-3)=0. So wt_11=0.

v14: sn=9, cp=2. sn/cp=4.5. 4.5-4=0.5. So wt_i=(0.5)^2=0.25. Total waiting time is 0 +0.25=0.25. Which matches the given value.

Revenue: cf *10 - sum(c_i). sum(c_i for s_2: v11 (6) + v14 (8) =14. So 10*10 -14=100-14=86. Correct.

So the calculations are accurate. Now, which solution is better?

The problem states that we need to pick the best solution according to the problem definition. The problem has two objectives: minimize waiting time and maximize revenue. Since these are conflicting objectives, it's a multi-objective problem. Without additional information on priorities or weights, we can't definitively say which is better. However, in multi-objective optimization, a solution is considered Pareto optimal if there's no other solution that is better in at least one objective without being worse in another. Here, s_2 is better in waiting time and worse in revenue compared to s_1. So neither dominates the other. However, perhaps the problem expects us to consider that the waiting time is the first objective (minimized), so maybe priority is given to the first objective. If that's the case, then s_2, which has a much lower waiting time (0.25 vs 16) but only a slightly lower revenue (86 vs 87) would be preferred. The gain in waiting time is significant, while the loss in revenue is minor. Alternatively, if both objectives are considered equally, but since they are conflicting, the user might need to make a trade-off. However, since the problem asks for the "best" solution, and given that the reference solutions provide both objectives, perhaps the answer expects to choose s_2 because the improvement in waiting time is drastic and the loss in revenue is minimal. Another way to look at it is in terms of the magnitudes: 16 to 0.25 is a 64-fold reduction in waiting time, while revenue only drops by 1. That seems like a good trade-off. Therefore, s_2 is the better solution.

The best solution is s_2. It significantly reduces the total waiting time (0.25 vs. 16) with only a minor decrease in revenue (86 vs. 87), making it the superior choice despite the slight trade-off in revenue.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

Evaluate Objectives:

s₁: Total waiting time = 16, Revenue = 87.

s₂: Total waiting time = 0.25, Revenue = 86.

Trade-off Analysis:

s₂ reduces waiting time by 98.4% (from 16 to 0.25) compared to s₁.

s₂ decreases revenue by 1.15% (from 87 to 86).

Dominance Check:

Neither solution strictly dominates the other (s₂ is better on waiting time, s₁ on revenue).

Priority Consideration:

The problem lists minimizing waiting time as the first objective, suggesting its importance. The drastic improvement in waiting time outweighs the negligible revenue loss.

Conclusion: s₂ is the best solution due to its substantial reduction in waiting time with minimal revenue impact.

Final Answer
The best solution is s_2.

\boxed{s_2}
